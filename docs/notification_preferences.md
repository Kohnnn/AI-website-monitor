# Notification Preferences

This document outlines the notification preferences available in the AI Website Monitor and how to use them.

## Available Preferences

### Notification Timing

Choose when notifications should be sent:

1. **Immediate**: Notifications are sent as soon as a website check is completed
2. **Daily Summary**: Notifications are bundled and sent at specific times each day
3. **Both**: Receive both immediate notifications and daily summaries

### Notification Content

Control what triggers a notification:

- **Notify only when changes are detected**: When enabled, you'll only receive notifications when changes are found on a website. When disabled, you'll receive notifications for every website check, regardless of whether changes were detected.

### Summary Times

For daily summaries, you can specify the times when summaries should be generated and sent:

- Enter times in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
- Separate multiple times with commas (e.g., `09:00,17:00`)
- Each time specified will trigger a summary notification containing all website changes since the last summary

## Setting Your Preferences

1. Go to the **Settings** page for your user
2. Under the **Notification Timing** section, you can set all preferences:
   - Select your timing preference (Immediate, Daily Summary, or Both)
   - Check/uncheck "Notify only when changes are detected"
   - Set your preferred summary times if using Daily Summary
3. Click **Update Preferences** to save your changes

## Notification Content

### Change Detected Notifications

When changes are detected, the notification includes:
- Website URL
- Timestamp of the check
- Detailed description of the changes (generated by AI)
- A screenshot (for email notifications)

### Status Notifications (when "Notify only when changes are detected" is disabled)

For checks where no changes are detected, you'll receive:
- Website URL
- Timestamp of the check
- Status message confirming no changes were detected
- Current website status

## Troubleshooting

- If you're not receiving notifications, check your email/Telegram/Teams settings
- For summary notifications, verify the summary times are in the correct format (HH:MM)
- Make sure your notification preference is correctly set (Immediate, Summary, or Both)
